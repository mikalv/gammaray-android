## Test
To test with loop devices, you may need to create empty disk images first.
You can follow [this tutorial](http://www.richud.com/wiki/Ubuntu_Create_Hard_Drive_Image) 
except two slight changes.

	1. Choose EXT instead of FAT; 

	2. Ignore the MBR step.                                 

## Device mapper 
[This tutorial](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Device-mapper) is the best I've seen so far.
Go to this when the device mapper options in the script need to be changed.
